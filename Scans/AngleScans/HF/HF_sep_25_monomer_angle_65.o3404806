WARNING: Lowdin charges are not invariant under rotations in the atomic orbital
basis. As a result, values can be be different between different versions of the
same basis set that span exactly the same space and give identical results for
physical observables. Mulliken charges (and Mayer bond orders) do not suffer
from this drawback.
